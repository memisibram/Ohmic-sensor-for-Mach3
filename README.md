# Ohmic-sensor-for-Mach3
Touch ohmic sensor for Mach3 plasma cutters

### About the project
This project is designed for use in plasma cutters using a Mach3 control card that communicates via a USB port.

While performing a probe search with the torch, the pilot arc cable is disabled and the torch nozzle is connected to an opamp integrated circuit. Once the probe search is complete, the pilot arc cable is reconnected, allowing the ohmic sensor to be used in HF-initiated pilot arc plasma cutters.
